## Introduction

*Docs as Code* is doing software documentation in the same way we do software development. We use the same tools that are used in software development—IDE, Git, and CI/CD—to write and publish a project's documentation. As a result, we deliver the documentation in the same way we deliver software.

### How We Implement Docs as Code

To deliver documentation as code, we follow a similar workflow as software development:

-  **Step 1. Create our documents as plain text files and use a Markup language.**  
We write our docs in reStructuredText.
-  **Step 2. Use an IDE to edit our documents.** 
We use Pycharm to edit all of our files.
-  **Step 3. Use a static site generator.** 
We use Sphinx. 
-  **Step 4. Use Git for file management and collaboration.** 
-  **Step 5. Test our documents.** 
We check for missing links.
-  **Step 6. Build and publish the documentation site continuously.**  
We adopt Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Development (CD) to deliver our documentation on a web server. We automatically deploy our documentation site after every commit we make.
